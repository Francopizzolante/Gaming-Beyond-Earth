# Gaming-Beyond-Earth
  Leveraging the unique conditions of microgravity, our project aims to develop a cognitive training device that also functions as an interactive game for astronauts. Our device comprises small, portable LED screens with motion sensors (10x10). With these screens, we can create various activities such as speed and agility games, reflex challenges, and competitive modes. Depending on the selected game mode, the devices can be used in a specific room or distributed. 
  
  To further enhance the physical aspect, astronauts will wear a harness-style vest equipped with an elastic band connected to the wrist, providing resistance to the arms during gameplay. Additionally, the vest will feature a health monitor to track the astronauts' physical condition in real time, ensuring both safety and performance optimization.
  
  By combining mental and physical stimulation in an engaging, competitive format, the device helps astronauts maintain cognitive acuity and physical coordination in microgravity. This innovation is vital as it fosters both mental sharpness and physical fitness, which are critical for astronauts' well-being in space, especially within the unique constraints of microgravity.
