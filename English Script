Slide 1: Zero-G Entertainment
"Zero-G Entertainment merges fun and fitness with a smart training device for astronauts. We use portable LED screens with motion sensors to power reflex games, while a vest adds resistance and tracks health in real-time, keeping astronauts sharp, fit, and mission-ready."

Slide 2: Game Modes
"Our system offers two game modes: stationary and free. In stationary mode, astronauts combine physical strength and reflexes with memory and musical challenges, while the free mode focuses on dynamic tasks like races or multi-tasking challenges, playable solo or with others."

Slide 3: LED Screens and Vest
"The LED screens are portable and equipped with sensors that detect interactions. The vest is a key component, with elastic bands that add a physical challenge, and it also monitors vital signs in real-time to ensure the astronaut’s health is tracked during gameplay."

Slide 4: Let’s Play!
"In Race Mode, for instance, astronauts compete to press the buttons as fast as possible when they light up. It can be played solo or in competitive mode, adding excitement to the experience."
